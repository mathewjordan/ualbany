                    <td id="program_overview">The University at Albany and the ECELA Spanish Language School gives you the chance to experience rapid advancement in Spanish abilities while experiencing first-hand the Argentine culture in and around Mendoza. As an intensive immersion course (Spanish classes within a &quot;Spanish everywhere&quot; environment), the program&#39;s goal is to give you several semesters worth of Spanish skill enhancement in only a few months. In addition to the 20 hour per week language course, you can also participate in cultural activities such as cooking classes, salsa dance lessons, Cinema Latino, and folklore shows.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        Argentine culture is commonly observed to be a hybrid of Europe sophistication and Latin American passion. Mendoza adds a rural charm and is often called the &quot;most liveable city in Argentina&quot;: it&#39;s well-organized, small enough to be relaxed, big enough to be interesting, and with a comfortable mountain climate.&nbsp; Just outside the city are family-run vineyards and traditional gaucho estancias.&nbsp; You can head to the nearby Andes for hiking, mountain biking, and rafting.&nbsp;<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        The school in Mendoza is in a modern residential area close to the town center.&nbsp; It&#39;s a comfortable building in a quiet location, but you&#39;ll still be within a short walk to the central plaza and dozens of restaurants and cafes - great for people-watching while doing your homework.</td>
